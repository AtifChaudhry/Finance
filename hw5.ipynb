The institution could then sell the combined coupons totaling \\$1,000 as a separate zero-coupon bond with maturities ranging from 6 months up to 30 years. This is a financial innovation that occurred decades ago in the face of volatile inflation and an increased demand for long-term zero coupon government bonds.

Recently, however, the company has run into some financial difficulty and has restructured its obligations.Today\u2019s coupon payment has already been paid, but the remaining coupon payments will be postponed until maturity. The postponed payments will accrue interest at an annual rate of 3% per year and will be paid as a lump sum amount at maturity along with the face value.
