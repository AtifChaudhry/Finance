In this simple, yet powerful scenario, today's stock price is the PV of next year's dividend and next year's stock price.) The stock of Alydar Oil, an all-equity firm, is currently trading at \\$45 per share, after just having paid a \\$2 per share dividend. The market expects a dividend of \\$3 per share to be paid one year from today.

When calculating the value of the stock today, you cannot decide if the constant growth rate will be 6% or 7%.

      "(15 points) GraceBook is a young firm that is in the process of creating a new web-based social media platform that is focused on the corporate market. While they are unable to pay any dividends today, once corporate contracts are awarded, they expect to be able to start paying a dividend of \\$2.00 per share beginning two years from now (t = 2). From that point forward, as they build their reputation and capacity, they expect to be able to increase their dividend each year at a constant rate. If GraceBook's current stock price is \\$31 and their cost of equity capital (the discount rate for equity) is 9%, what is the growth rate implied by this price per share?

      "(15 points) Viento Windmills is a utility that charges customers for their wind generated electricity. With their current technology, they earn a total of \\$50 million each year to pay out to their 2 million shareholders. While their geographic footprint is fixed and we can't expect the climate to get progressively windier over time, they do have an opportunity to invest in technology that will more efficiently extract the wind energy and thus produce more megawatts to sell to customers. A one-time investment at the end of this year (t = 1) of \\$25 million for a state of the art lubricant system for the windmills will increase their cash flows by \\$10 million per year starting the following year (t = 2) and in perpetuity. If Viento plans to make the investment and cost of equity capital (the discount rate for equity) is 9%, calculate the increase or decrease in the share price of Viento as a result of this decision.
