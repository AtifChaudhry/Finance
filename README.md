<em>It has often been said that a person doesn't really understand something until he teaches it to someone else. Actually a person doesn't really understand something until he can teach it to a computer, i.e., express it as an algorithm ... The attempt to formulate things as algorithms leads to a much deeper understanding than if we simply try to understand things in the traditional way.<br>
(Donald E. Knuth)</em>
